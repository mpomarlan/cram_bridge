  "Calls MoveIt's compute_cartesian_path to get a path from robot-state-msg that passes through the waypoints given by waypoint-poses with the link link-name.

The waypoint poses are given in the frame identified by frame-name.

Between two waypoints, the generated path will have the link move in a line.

max-step gives the largest distance (in Cartesian space) that will be allowed between two points in the generated path.

jump-threshold gives a distance in configuration (joint) space which, if exceeded between consecutive waypoints, is interpreted as a jump in the IK solution.
If a jump happens, MoveIt! considers the path generation failed, and will return a path that ends just before the jump (see \"completion fraction\" in the
return values)

avoid-collisions determines whether obstacle collisions (apart from those in the allowed collision matrix) are tolerated. Set to T to signal collisions are
not ok.

path-constraints-msg describes any other kinematic constraints the path must satisfy.

Return values:

is a list of lists: ((\"start state\" start_state) (\"trajectory\" solution) (\"completion fraction\" fraction))

fraction is a number between 0 and 1 which gives how much of the requested path was actually produced. If a path satisfying the constraints and not 
colliding with unwanted obstacles is found, then the completion fraction is 1. A lesser number signals a kinematic jump or an obstacle collision."
